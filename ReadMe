**This project uses one Raspberry Pi and so the code is to be run on one raspberry pi**

1) Copy paste the code into a RaspberryPi editor
2) The circuit is to be setup as shown in the video
3) Once the circuit is done we will need a sample of soil or wet cloth to simulate the level of moisture found in the ground.
4) After that we can run the code from the terminal or from the code editor directly. 
5) Once this is done the expected result should be displaayed on the screen.
